My compiler project from Wesley Mackey's
[CMPS 104A: Fundamentals of Compiler Design I](https://courses.soe.ucsc.edu/courses/cmps104a)
at UC Santa Cruz in Spring 2015.

__If you are a current student in that course, or plan to take it at some point
in the future, do not read this repository. Cheating is wrong.__

Like most students, I didn't quite finish the project. The intended features
of the compiler and the specification of oc, the toy language it compiles, are
detailed in the documents in the [Assignments](Assignments/) directory. I
completed everything from the first four assignments, and barely got started
on assignment 5.

The [starter-code](starter-code/) directory contains the skeleton code that
Professor Mackey provided at the beginning of the quarter, and
[oc-programs](oc-programs/) contains a number of sample oc programs he provided
that serve to test various features of the compiler. Some of the latter have
intentionally invalid syntax.
